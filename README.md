# VR_Project_Planetarium

This was the final prototype that was used to make a video showcasing the concept of a VR rollercoaster ride.
It's goal was to show the client how VR allows for more immersion than just the google streetview application they already had and to convince them to make a new VR application.

There are two scenes in this file. One is the actual prototype, and the other was for testing purposes.
